# Publishes tsbTheMachine as a GitHub release — the build RapidFX and RapidJ pin to.
#
#   dist/release-tsb.sh 27.1.0
#
# What comes out:
#   tag      tsbthemachine-<version>              on the current HEAD (must be pushed)
#   asset    tsbthemachine-dist-<version>.tar.gz  unpacks to tsbthemachine-<version>/
#   notes    the SHA-1 of the asset, to be written into TheMachine.java of both projects
#
# Why a release and not Sonatype: this is GPL2, and whoever hosts the binary owes the corresponding
# source. A release tagged on the commit it was built from is that correspondence, in one place and
# at no cost. See NOTICE.
#
# Tags before tsbthemachine-27.1.0 were called tsbmobile-* and live in thorstenstueker/robovm,
# which is archived and stays readable for exactly that reason.
#
# Prerequisites: JDK 21 as JAVA_HOME, the VM binaries under compiler/vm/target/binaries
# (see README "Building"), a clean working tree, gh logged in.

# The tree must correspond to a commit — except for what the build itself regenerates.

# compiler/swift/src/main/robopods holds the xcframework build-natives.sh produces. It is tracked
# on purpose, so that a clone without a Swift toolchain can still build, and it is therefore
# rewritten by every build. Two measurements from 27.09.2026, after ZERO_AR_DATE=1 and after
# sorting the xcframework's Info.plist: the archives still differ by **16 bytes** between two runs
# over identical source — a hash inside the Swift object, not a timestamp, and not worth chasing
# further.
#
# Excluding it does not weaken what this check is for. The correspondence GPL2 asks for is between
# the released binary and the *source* it was built from, and that source — src/main/swift/*.swift
# — is tracked and is covered here. A regenerated artefact differing in a hash is the same
# artefact. Anything else being dirty still stops the release.

# iCloud copies, out of the way before anything is packaged.

# This repository sits under ~/Documents, which is mirrored, and the file service resolves what it
# thinks are conflicts by writing "Foo 2.class" beside "Foo.class" — including inside target/, where
# nobody looks. On 28.09.2026 the tsbmobile-27.0.0 release went out with **502 of them inside
# robovm-rt.jar**:
# stale duplicates of real classes, carrying an older API. They declare the same internal class name
# as the originals, so anything keyed by class name rather than by path reads whichever comes last
# in the zip. ApiDelta did exactly that and reported 59 methods missing from java.util.Arrays that
# have been there all along.
#
# Deleted rather than merely reported: a build that is one `rm` away from correct should take it.

# The distribution ships the release libraries only, and the VM build does not know that.

# compiler/vm/build.sh defaults to BUILDS="debug release" and installs both into
# compiler/vm/target/binaries, the debug ones suffixed -dbg.a. The assembly then takes **/* and
# would pack fourteen archives per architecture where the published tsbmobile-27.0.2 has seven.
#
# That release was right by accident: whoever built it had a release-only tree. Checked against the
# published artefact on 28.09.2026 — no -dbg.a anywhere in it. So the decision is written down here
# instead of depending on the state somebody's build directory happens to be in.
#
# Removed rather than excluded in the assembly, because the assembly is upstream's and the next
# import would lose the change.

The mobile compiler and runtime for RapidFX and RapidJ: class files up to version 61, a runtime library being filled in against Java 25, CocoaTouch reduced to what a rendered interface needs, and Swing on UIView.

Android compiles ahead of time now, not just the VM core. A Java file becomes an arm64 binary that runs under \`adb shell\`, or — with \`-target androidlib\` — the \`lib<name>.so\` an APK carries in \`lib/arm64-v8a/\`: it loads in ART, and our VM starts inside the ART process.

A fork of RoboVM/MobiVM for our own purposes — see NOTICE for the origin and the licence.
